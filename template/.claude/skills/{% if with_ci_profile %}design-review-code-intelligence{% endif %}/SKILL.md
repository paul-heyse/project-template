name: design-review-code-intelligence
description: Code-intelligence profile for the design-review skill — applies CI-01–CI-13 and gates CI-G1–CI-G3 (attributed facts, typed fidelity with no relabelled relations, relationship identity, unknown-is-not-absent, declared graph projections, claims relative to a stated model, routing analyses by semantics, bounded cardinality, governed heuristics, hermetic analysis inputs, evidence closure for served claims, non-circular evaluation, pinned serving). Use together with design-review whenever the subject is static analysis, fact extraction, code graphs, program or graph analyses, retrieval, or evidence-backed answers served to agents.

# Design review — code-intelligence profile

This skill **layers onto `design-review`**; it never replaces it. Load the core skill first.
The core fixes slots 1–12, foundations FP-01–FP-06, architectural judgments A1–A3,
gates G1–G8, findings and decisions. This profile adds domain constraints. Its fact and
fidelity analysis supports ownership, contracts, change and composition; it does not replace them.

## The standard

Find the profile through the repository's `standard.toml` (`[[profiles]]` entry
`code-intelligence`). It points to two documents:

| Document | Role |
|---|---|
| Profile principles | CI-01–CI-13 with the core principles each refines, gates CI-G1–CI-G3, false positives, and the functional target the design must serve |
| Profile review additions | What the profile adds to each core slot: fact and fidelity table, analysis record columns, journeys, known-answer shapes, and calibrated finding shapes |

Profile principles tighten core principles; a profile MUST is never waived by an exception
record. The repository binding says which analyzers, stores and libraries fill each role. This
profile names none.

## What the profile adds to the review

1. **Profile gates CI-G1–CI-G3 in slot 6**, settled independently like the core gates.
2. **The fact and fidelity table** (slot 2), after the responsibility/dependency map.
   Reconstruct it from the subject; invented cells are unresolved decisions.
3. **Analysis record columns in slot 4** for every projection, analysis or synthesis stage.
4. **Code-intelligence journeys in slot 5**, chosen by relevance. In a target-purpose review the
   workloads in the profile's functional target are in scope even when current plans exclude them.
5. **Architectural consequences of domain changes:** distinguish a new semantic category from
   an ordinary model addition. Trace whether extraction, proofs, validation and serving
   independently classify the same concept, and identify the affected owners.

## Lenses

Fidelity and evidence claims are easy to assert in prose. Trace them through the design or code,
using judgment about where doubt is material:

- **Follow a served claim backwards** (CI-11): answer → synthesis → finding → fact → span, all in
  one snapshot. The step where a citation could resolve elsewhere, or where "mentions" stands in
  for "establishes", is usually the finding.
- **Follow an empty answer** (CI-04): what coverage sits under it, and does the served form say
  "none" or "not known"?
- **Read each relation at its source** (CI-02): what did the provider actually assert, and is it
  consumed under that meaning downstream?
- **Check each projection's universe** (CI-05): is anything filtered before a traversal or a
  global metric that the answer depends on?
- **Find the model** (CI-06): for each behavioural claim, which runtime model and assumptions,
  and are they visible where the claim is served?
- **Trace heuristics to their consumers** (CI-09): may a ranking, community or similarity output
  become a control, limit or behaviour in a served answer?
- **Look for ambient inputs** (CI-10, CI-12): analyzer configuration discovered at run time, and
  any path from evaluation references into inputs or parameters.

A known-answer shape (profile review additions, slot 10) settles a doubtful graph or analysis
claim cheaply; use one where reasoning leaves real doubt.

## Failure modes specific to this profile

- An empty result accepted as evidence that a caller, use or capability does not exist.
- A relation's meaning taken from its name rather than from what its provider asserts.
- A heuristic score or community accepted as a structural or behavioural fact.
- A behavioural claim judged sound without asking which model it assumes.
- Evidence closure judged from the synthesis code alone, without following a claim to its facts.
