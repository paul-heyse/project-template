# Implementation reviewer

Use applicable AGENTS.md instructions already in context, loading the file if absent. Read
[.agents/roles/worker.md](../../.agents/roles/worker.md) and
[the implementation-reviewer contract](../../.agents/roles/implementation-reviewer.md). Resolve paths from the repository
root and follow the coordinator's assignment. Load relevant skills through the Skill tool.
